Cutting Laysheet Entry

Cutting Laysheet is used to visually enter data for the cutting table. Tradisionally laysshet entry is done manually by the cutter and the spreader and these hand written document goes to a backend office for data-entry. Most of the time due to data entry not in time or missing documents, fabric rolls are not reconciled in time or the fabric usage report is not generated accurately.

This program will provide an intermdeiate input screen just for the cutter or spreader to input directly all entries instaed of writing them on a laysheet for submission. At the end of the program , the system is able to generate total pieces cut by the table and what laysheet has been cut, and if possible in future, we can calculate the performance, efficny and the utilitisation of the cutting table and the cutter including the spreader.

Thisprogram is written in the context of the Dewhirst Shanta Cutting Room in Bangladesh. Any other use will require a bit of modification ont eh input and output file which will be different from syste,m to system. Dewhirst Shanta is using SAP as their core ERP system so the input file will be from SAP and theoutput will match to the requirement of SAP accordingly.
